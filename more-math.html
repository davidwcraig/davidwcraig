<h1>A bit of math</h1>

<p>
The flow of heat through a medium can be described by a flux vector `vec F`,
whose direction gives the direction of the heat flow and whose magnitude gives
the magnitude of the heat flow in cal / cmÂ² / sec. This vector `vec F` is
related to the gradient of the temperature `T` by the thermal conductivity `K`
of the medium: </p>
<p>
`vec F = - K grad T.`
</p>
<p>
We also introduce the specific heat `c` and the density `rho` of the medium.
</p>
<p>
In terms of these quantities we can write two different but equal expressions
for the rate of change with time `t` of the heat `Q` in a volume `V`:
</p>
<p>
`(dQ)/(dt) = int_V d^3 x c rho (del T)/(del t) = - int_S d vec A * vec F`
</p>
