<h1>A bit of math</h1>
<h2>Heat flow</h2>
<p>
The flow of heat through a medium can be described by a flux vector `vec F`,
whose direction gives the direction of the heat flow and whose magnitude gives
the magnitude of the heat flow in cal / cmÂ² / sec. This vector `vec F` is
related to the gradient of the temperature `T` by the thermal conductivity `K`
of the medium: </p>
<p>
`vec F = - K grad T.`
</p>
<p>
We also introduce the specific heat `c` and the density `rho` of the medium.
</p>
<p>
In terms of these quantities we can write two different but equal expressions
for the rate of change with time `t` of the heat `Q` in a volume `V`:
</p>
<p>
`(dQ)/(dt) = int_V d^3 x \  c rho (del T)/(del t) = - int_S d vec A * vec F`
</p>

<h2> The wave equation </h2>
<p>
Consider a string of mass per unit length `sigma`, under tension `T`, stretched
along the `x`-axis and then subjected to a <em>transverse</em> displacement
`u(x,t)`.
</p><p>
Newton's second law, applied to the transverse motion of a small length `dx` of
the string, assumes the form
</p><p>
`(T sin theta)_(x+dx) - (T sin theta)_x = sigma dx (del^2 u)/(del^2 t) . `
</p><p>
For a <strong>sufficiently small displacement</strong> `u`, such that 
`(del u)/(del x) lt lt 1`, we can approximate `sin theta approx tan theta approx
(del u)/(del x)`  and the transverse component of the force in the string is
given by
</p><p>
`T sin theta approx T (del u)/(del x) . `
</p><p>
Newton's second law then simplifies to
</p><p>
` (del)/(del x) (T (del u)/(del x) ) = sigma (del^2 u)/(del t^2) . `
</p><p>
If there is no longitudinal motion of the string, `T = "constant" ` and we
obtain the one-dimensional wave equation,
</p><p>
` (del^2 u)/(del x^2) = 1/(c^2) (del^2 u)/(del t^2) ,`
</p><p>
where
</p><p>
` c = sqrt( T / c ) ` 
</p><p>
is the velocity of waves in the string.
