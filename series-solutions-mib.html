<h1>Agent K makes you learn a new way to solve differential equations.</h1>

<p>So one day you are feeling nostalgic about trigonometry and you decide to look
at your old trig book because it is relatively easy now. A pug dog suddenly
arives and begins to strike up a conversation with you. In the midst of your
freak-out, Agent K arrives with his neuralyzer, tells the dog to get lost, and
makes you forget the whole thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you also forget all about sines and cosines.
</p>
<p>The next day you take a look at your homework. It says "find the solutions of
the second order differential equation ` y'' + y = 0. `"  You write the equation
down:
</p>
<p>` y'' + y = 0. `
</p>

<p>It looks strangely familiar but you can't think of any function to try. But
you do remember that functions can be written as power series: </p> 

<p>` f(x) = sum_(n = 0)^oo a_n x^n. `
</p>
<p>You think, well, I can deal with this one or two terms at a time. <em>You
are now following in the footsteps of Isaac Newton.</em>
</p>
<p>` y'(x) = dy/dx = sum_(n=1)^oo n a_n x^(n-1) `
</p>
<p>` y''(x) = (d^2 y)/(dx^2) = sum_(n=2)^oo n (n - 1) a_n x^(n-2) `
</p>
<p>Plug this into the differential equation:
</p>
<p>` sum_(n=2)^oo n (n - 1) a_n x^(n-2) + sum_(n = 0)^oo a_n x^n = 0 `
</p>
<p>Now you want the powers `x^n` to all match up, so you substitute
`n+2` for `n` in the first sum, shifting the indices:
</p>
<p>` sum_(n=0)^oo (n+2) (n + 1) a_(n+2) x^n + sum_(n = 0)^oo a_n x^n = 0 `
</p>
<p>Group:
</p>
<p>` sum_(n=0)^oo [ (n+2)(n+1) a_(n+2) + a_n ] x^n = 0`
</p>
<p>In order for this to be zero, the quantity in brackets above must vanish:
</p>
<p>` (n+2)(n+1)a_(n+2) + a_n = 0. `
</p>
<p>This is known as a <em>recurrence relation.</em> Also note that in this case,
the terms that are related are spaced two apart in index, so we will have to
treat odd and even cases separately (starting one set from `a_0` and one set
from `a_1`).  First we can rearrange the recurrence relation thusly:
</p>
<p>` a_(n+2) = - (a_n)/((n+2)(n+1)). `
</p>
<p>We get the even terms from the relation:
</p>
<p>
` {: ( a_2 = - (a_0)/(2*1) ),
    (  a_4 = - (a_2)/(4*3) = + (a_0)/(4*3*2*1) ),
    (  a_6 = - (a_4)/(6*5) = - (a_0)/(6*5*4*3*2*1) ) :} `
</p>
<p>If we now want to write these with and index spacing of one, and we look at
the pattern we get for `n = 2k`
</p>
<p>`a_(2k) = ( (-1)^k )/(2k!) a_0`, `k = 1,2,3...`
</p>
<p>Now the odd ones:
</p>
<p>
` {: ( a_3 = - (a_1)/(3*2) ),
    (  a_5 = - (a_3)/(5*4) = + (a_1)/(5*4*3*2) ),
    (  a_7 = - (a_5)/(7*6) = - (a_1)/(7*6*5*4*3*2) ) :} `
</p>
<p>Again we look at the pattern and get a single-stepping index for odd numbers.
Let `n = 2k + 1`:
</p>
<p>
` a_(2k+1) = ( (-1)^k )/( (2k+1)! ) a_1`, `k = 1,2,3...`
</p>
<p>
Now our series looks like this:
</p>
<p>
`y(x) = a_0 + a_1 x - a_0/2! x^2 - a_1/3! x^3 + a_0/4! x^4 + a_1/5! x^5 - cdots`
</p>
<p>which we can write</p>
<p>
` y(x) = a_0 sum_(n=0)^oo ( (-1)^n )/( (2n)! ) x^(2n) 
    + a_1 sum_(n=0)^oo ( (-1)^n )/( (2n+1)! ) x^(2n+1) `
</p>
<p>
You may realize these are two independent solutions of our second-order
differential equation, which is what you expect. Congratulations, you've
rediscovered the sine and cosine! Now why does this remind you of a small
talking dog?
</p>
<p>
` y(x) = a_0 cos x + a_1 sin x. `
</p>
