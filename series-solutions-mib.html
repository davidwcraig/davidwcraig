<h1>Agent K makes you learn a new way to solve differential equations.</h1>

<p>So one day you are feeling nostalgic about trigonometry and you decide to look
at your old trig book because it is relatively easy now. A pug dog suddenly
arives and begins to strike up a conversation with you. In the midst of your
freak-out, Agent K arrives with his neuralyzer, tells the dog to get lost, and
makes you forget the whole thing.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you also forget all about sines and cosines.
</p>
<p>The next day you take a look at your homework. It says "find the solutions of
the second order differential equation ` y'' + y = 0. `"  You write the equation
down:
</p>
<p>` y'' + y = 0. `
</p>

It looks strangely familiar but you can't think of any function to try. But you
do remember that functions can be written as power series:

` f(x) = sum_(n = 0)^00 a_n x^n.
